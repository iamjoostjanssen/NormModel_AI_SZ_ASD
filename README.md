# NormModel_AI_SZ_ASD
Individualized Cortical Thickness Asymmetry in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia

This repository contains R code pertaining to the study Individualized Cortical Thickness Asymmetry in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia.
We created a docker that includes the [PCN-toolkit](https://pcntoolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and added extra automated features for model evaluation and visualization. 
Instructions for installing and running the docker for normative modelling can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ/blob/main/Docker_and_ReferenceModelling.txt). Demographical, clinical and MRI acquisition details of the included samples for the training and test sets can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_AI_SZ_ASD/tree/main/Study%20details). The symmetric parcellation (160 regions of similar size) used in the main approach can be found [here](https://github.com/RafaelRomeroGarcia/subParcellation_symmetric). The Schaefer high-resolution parcellation (500 regions/hemisphere) used in the A1 approach can be found [here](https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/brain_parcellation/Schaefer2018_LocalGlobal). The Freesurfer code for alternative cortical thickness asymmetry methodology used in the A2 approach can be found [here](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/Xhemi). The figures containing cortical surface renderings were made using [fsbrain](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fsbrain/vignettes/fsbrain.html).
