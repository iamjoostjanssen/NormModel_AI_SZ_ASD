# NormModel_AI_SZ_ASD
Normative Modelling of Cortical Thickness Asymmetry Index in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia

This repository contains code pertaining to the study Normative Modelling of the Asymmetry Index (AI) in Health, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Schizophrenia.
We created a docker that includes the [PCN-toolkit](https://pcntoolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and added extra automated features for model evaluation and visualization. 
Instructions for installing and running the docker for normative modelling can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ/blob/main/Docker_and_ReferenceModelling.txt). The figures containing cortical surface renderings were made using [fsbrain](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fsbrain/vignettes/fsbrain.html).
