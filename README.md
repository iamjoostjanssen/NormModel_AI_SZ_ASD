Normative Modelling of Cortical Thickness Asymmetry Index in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia

This repository contains information pertaining to the study Normative Modelling of the Asymmetry Index (AI) in Health, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Schizophrenia.
We created a docker that includes the [PCN-toolkit](https://pcntoolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and added extra automated features for model evaluation and visualization. 
Instructions for installing and running the docker for normative modelling can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ/blob/main/Docker_and_ReferenceModelling.txt). 
A list of study IDs from included subjects and their AI values for all included regions can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_SulcWidth_SZ/blob/main/Included_subjects_IDs.csv). 
The centile plots for all included regions can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_SulcWidth_SZ/tree/main/Normative_models_lh), 
[here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_SulcWidth_SZ/tree/main/Normative_models_rh), respectively. 
The figures containing cortical surface representations were created using [fsbrain](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain).
